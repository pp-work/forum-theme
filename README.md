This is a highly tailored version of [Kasper Kronborg Isager's](https://github.com/kasperisager) [Bootstrap for Vanilla](https://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-bootstrap), developed by/for [Piratpartiet](http://www.piratpartiet.se/).

Currently it depends on the [Vanilla-PirateWeb-Plugin](https://github.com/pp-work/Vanilla-PirateWeb-Plugin) being installed, because without it, Smarty will die complaining about an unrecognized tag. This will be fixed. In the meantime, you can edit `views/default.master.tpl` and remove the two instances of {pw_link}.

Initial development & launch had to happen quickly so it's a bit messy and hairy in places.

To make it look the way it was intended, enable "Display root categories as headings" in Forum Settings -> Categories.

To set a category-specific icon (using [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)) for the category page, edit a subcategory. If you'd like to use, say, [fa-binoculars](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/binoculars/), type in  `fa-fa-binoculars` in the field "Css Class". To set a color, add one of `pp-purple pp-orange pp-limegrepp-pink pp-yellow pp-red pp-blue pp-darkblupp-turquoise` (defined in `less/themes/pirat.less`).

We don't use activities. If you want them, edit or remove `views/activity/all.php`.

## Compiling assets

The following instructions assume that you have already installed Node.js on your computer. If this is not the case, please download and install the latest stable release from the official [Node.js download page](http://nodejs.org/download/). If you are using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you can also install Node.js via the command line:

```sh
$ brew install node
```

> __Notice__: It is important that you install Node in a way that does not require you to `sudo`.

Once you have Node.js up and running, you will need to install the local dependencies using [npm](http://npmjs.org):

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Tasks

#### Build - `npm run build`
Compiles all theme assets using Gulp. LESS stylesheets will be compiled to [`design/style.css`](design/style.css) and Javascripts will be concatenated and output to [`js/custom.js`](js/custom.js).

#### Watch - `npm run watch`
Watches the assets for changes and runs the appropriate Gulp tasks. Also starts a Livereload server that will push the changes to your Vanilla installation automatically.
